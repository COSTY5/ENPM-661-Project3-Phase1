ENPM 661 Project 3 Phase 1
1. Install all the necessary libraries such as “numpy”, “matplotlib”, “math”, “heapq”.
2. Run the code.
3. The code will ask for 6 inputs: Start_x (should be between 0 to 600), Start_y (should be between 0 to 250), start orientation, goal_x (same range as start_x), goal_y (same range as start_y) and goal orientation.
4. The output if the goal node is found will be the total time taken to execute the program, total cost required to reach the goal and the final output of the workspace with the optimal path drawn on it.
